Wireframe: is the skeleton of a webpage that demonstrates what the components will be on the page.

Technology: Visual Studio Code was used in the creation of the wireframe.

I found this project to be very difficult. I have no background in coding. It took me more than 3 hours to do this project. Slowly, I'm getting the hang of floating. Moving boxes from side to side. There is still much more to learn. I also recieved a lot of help from my study group and my sister's fiance.
